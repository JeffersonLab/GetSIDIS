This tries to study acceptane and record the results in some histograms

shoot particles from target position over target length into the detector and look for the hits on various detectors, if there is a hit, this event is considered detected and the generated particle P and theta, phi are recorded.

geantino can be used to test neutron particle
chargedgeantino(+1 particle) can be used to test positive particle
chargedgeantino(+1 particle) and flip field by gemc option SCALE_FIELD="field_name, -1" can be used to test negative particle
Use real particle to include decay effect

In geometry, use only vaccum and "Kryptonite" as material to make sure particles can get blocked and use virtualplane in front of detectors to see particle hits by GEMC built-in flux bank with "true info" turned on

When analyzing results, include fiducial cuts to choose good detector areas

here is how to use it
1. run simulation with the gcard included like "gemc acceptance_solid_SIDIS_He3_electron.gcard"
2. convert output from evio to root like "eveio2root -INPUTF=acceptance_solid_SIDIS_He3_electron.evio"
3. analyze results by "root 'acceptance.C+("acceptance_solid_SIDIS_He3_electron.root")'" (the script runs much faster when compiled)
4. there are some picture output and histgrams in another root file acceptance_solid_SIDIS_He3_electron_output.root
5. there are a few histgrams in another root file acceptance_solid_SIDIS_He3_electron_output_final.root which is only some histgrams for late use

A good acceptance needs large enough statistics to prevents any artifucal structures like holes.

In the output root file, acceptance in P, theta, phi histograms are stored.
By definition, acceptance of a particle should be 0 or 1 if all degree of freedom are taken into consideration, including particle 3 momentum and particle 3 vertex.
Here we only record results in 3 momentum and integral over 3 vertex with a assumption that particles are evenly distributed over their 3 vertex, thus we have acceptance value between 0 and 1

For solid_PVDIS, histogram "acceptance_ThetaP_forwardangle" is in Theta and P
For solid_SIDIS_He3, solid_JPsi, histogram "acceptance_ThetaP_forwardangle" and "acceptance_ThetaP_largeangle" is in Theta and P
For solid_SIDIS_NH3, histogram "acceptance_ThetaPhiP_largeangle" and "acceptance_ThetaPhiP_forwardangle" are in Theta, Phi and P
